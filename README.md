I am very familiar with PHP/Laravel/CI, Node.js/React.js/Angular.js, Solidity/Truffle/Hardhat, Web3.js/Ether.js, Open Zeppelin.
And had experiences with smart contracts, several types of token(ERC20/ECR721/ERC1155) deployment, building new Crypto Wallet, Auto trading Bot / Snipping Bot(Front-run, Arbitrage), DEX fork, Defi platform for Staking / Yield farm / Lending & borrowing system / NFT marketplace / Crypto Game(play to earn) in several blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon.

Hope to work on your project and finish all perfectly.
Thank you.
Best Regards.
